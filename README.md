# Gardenbuilder

GraphQL API and database interface for Gardenbuilder

## About

Made with Typescript, TypeORM, Postgres and GraphQL

## Getting Started

### Database Setup

You'll need to also set up a postgresql database. I would follow the directions [here](https://tutorial-extensions.djangogirls.org/en/optional_postgresql_installation/).

Alternatively, you could run postgresql locally using docker: `docker run -e POSTGRES_USER=root -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret -e POSTGRES_DB=gardenbuilder -p 127.0.0.1:5432:5432/tcp library/postgres`

Once you have postgresql set up, follow these steps:
- while logged in as root, make a table with the same name as your  desired username. If your username is `coolUser`, for example, name your table `coolUser`
- make a `main` database and a `test` database
- give your user privileges to those tables with `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE main TO coolUser;` and `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE test TO coolUser`;

### Environment Variable Setup

Finally, you'll need to add the following into the `.env` file at the root of the project:

```
LOCAL_DATABASE_HOST=localhost
LOCAL_DATABASE_USER=yourUserName
LOCAL_DATABASE_PASSWORD=yourPassword
JWT_HASH_KEY=key
PORT=8000
```

### To Run

To stand up the database run `docker-compose up`

At project root, type `npm run build` then `npm run start:dev`. This will start the API. You'll want to open up a second terminal at root and type `npm run watch` so that your code changes are compiled from typescript to javascript as you save them. 

Then navigate to [localhost:8000/graphql](http://localhost:8000/graphql).
You should see the graphiQL editor and be able to write queries like

```graphql
query {
  gardens {
    name
  }
}
```

### To Run Tests

Run `npm test` or `npm run test`. Tests also automatically run each time you try to make a `git commit`
